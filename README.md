README.md - UW_2017_Q4_HW01 - Due: Thursday, October 12, 2017 08:00AM

Create a new Git repository on your computer called "semantic_tags". Within it, create an HTML document (any name you like) that uses at least 15 different types of HTML tags. Use any you like, but they must be used properly- if you are new to HTML I would recommend avoiding table elements. The topic and content of the document can be of your choosing (a bio page for yourself or someone else is a good default topic). Push your repository up to Github, and submit the URL of the repository.

Remember to make sure that Brackets is set to "Spaces: 2"! If they are just normal tabs, they'll look really weird on Github and I'll think your code styling is poor, which will impact your grade.

To submit your assignment:
1. Use the "Submit Assignment" link located on the top right corner.
2. Enter the URL of your "semantic_tags" Github repository.
3. Press the "Submit Assignment" button to turn in your assignment.
